# JavaNBodySimulation

This program is able to simulate the positions and trajectories of N bodies in 2D. I used JavaFX for the UI and the graphics of the main program. Using Newton's law of gravity, the forces on N bodies are calculated at discrete time steps and drawn onto the window. The radius of each body depends on their mass.
